 # E-bike Catalog

A modern and dynamic web application designed to showcase a collection of electric bikes.  
This project uses **React** on the frontend, **Strapi** as a headless CMS, and **Material UI (MUI)** for stylish UI components.  

The main goal is to provide users with a smooth experience browsing, filtering, and viewing bike models in detail.
